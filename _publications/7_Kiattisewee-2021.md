## Abstract

CRISPR-Cas transcriptional programming in bacteria is an emerging tool to regulate gene expression for metabolic pathway engineering. Here we implement CRISPR-Cas transcriptional activation (CRISPRa) in P. putida using a system previously developed in E. coli. We provide a methodology to transfer CRISPRa to a new host by first optimizing expression levels for the CRISPRa system components, and then applying rules for effective CRISPRa based on a systematic characterization of promoter features. Using this optimized system, we regulate biosynthesis in the biopterin and mevalonate pathways. We demonstrate that multiple genes can be activated simultaneously by targeting multiple promoters or by targeting a single promoter in a multi-gene operon. This work will enable new metabolic engineering strategies in P. putida and pave the way for CRISPR-Cas transcriptional programming in other bacterial species.
