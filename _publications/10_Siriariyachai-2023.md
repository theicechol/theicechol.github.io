## Abstract

Sparking method has been demonstrated as a powerful method in nanoparticles synthesis. In this research, we proposed a UV light irradiation strategy to enhance the nanoparticle fabrication technique. The sparking method was performed under UV light irradiation without heat treatment for In2O3 nanoparticle films preparation. The results showed that UV light can effect on properties of In2O3 nanoparticle films as a function of light intensity. The mechanism was proposed based on photoelectric effect. Under UV light irradiation, the In2O3 nanoparticles aggregated and accumulated faster and efficiency of adhesion between particles during their collisions was improved. Additionally, the band gap energy of In2O3 decreased with increasing the intensity of UV light irradiation.
