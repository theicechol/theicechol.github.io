# In brief about Ice

Ice is a Ph.D. graduate from the Molecular Engineering and Sciences program at the University of Washington working under the supervision of [James Carothers](https://sites.google.com/view/carothersresearchgroup/home?authuser=0) and [Jesse Zalatan](https://depts.washington.edu/jzlab/drupal/). 
During the Ph.D., Ice works on developing a bacterial CRISPR tool for the genetic manipulation of various microbes mainly for applications in Metabolic Engineering and Signaling. After graduation, Ice is interested in engineering of the multi-organism community, including that of microbial consortia and cross-kingdom interaction.

Ice will be moving to MIT through the [Engineering Excellence Postdoctoral Program](https://engineering.mit.edu/the-mit-postdoctoral-fellowship-program-for-engineering-excellence/) starting September 2024 to join [James J. Collins](https://www.collinslab.mit.edu/) team. Looking forward to the rich academic and biotech community in Boston!!!

Ice is originally from Thailand where he graduated with B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Organic Chemistry at Mahidol University, Bangkok, focusing on mechanistic study of antibiotic function. Then, he shifted gear into Enzyme Biocatalysis research at Vidhyasirimedhi Institute of Technology (VISTEC), Rayong, working as a founding member of the school of Biomolecular Sciences and Engineering. Ice moved to Seattle in 2018 to explore the frontier of Synthetic Biology research.

Whenever Seattle weather is permissive, Ice enjoys hiking and surfing apart from getting beaten up in Muay Thai training. Check out Ice's instagram for his collections of natural and cultural capture.

## Ice in the communities

Ice is active in various communities ranging from his MolES Ph.D. program to national associations. Beyond UW, Ice serves as a board member of Engineering Biology Research Consortium ([EBRC](https://ebrc.org/)) - Student and Postdoc Association ([SPA](https://ebrc.org/cholpisit-kiattisewee/)) working on fostering the SynBio community in the US and beyond. With the team met at EBRC, we co-founded the SynBio4ALL intitiative to promote Synthetic Biology education for African students. Ice is also supporting the SynBio community in Thailand prior to the founding of Thailand Synthetic Biology Consortium through both academic lectureship and public communication.
