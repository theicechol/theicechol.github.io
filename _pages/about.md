# About Ice

Ice is a Ph.D. graduate at the University of Washington working under the supervision of [James Carothers](https://sites.google.com/view/carothersresearchgroup/home?authuser=0) and [Jesse Zalatan](https://depts.washington.edu/jzlab/drupal/). He works on developing a bacterial CRISPR tool for the genetic rewiring of various microbes mainly for application in Metabolic Engineering and Signaling. He is originally from Thailand where he graduated with B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Organic Chemistry before shifting into the Engineering Biology world. Whenever Seattle weather is permissive, Ice enjoys hiking and surfing apart from getting beaten up in Muay Thai training.
