ASBMB Annual Meeting or [DiscoverBMB](https://discoverbmb.asbmb.org/2023-recordings) is a big scientific conference in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.
Ice presented orally in the <b>Session: New mechanisms for transcriptional control of gene expression</b>.
As a local Seattleite, Ice acted as a host to show friends around the town!!! Especially for good food~~~
