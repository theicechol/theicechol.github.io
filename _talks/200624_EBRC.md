Ice presented his research at the EBRC Virtual Seminar Series in the theme of <b>Engineering Genetic Regulatory Networks</b>.
It was a pretty short preparation time since Ice know only a day earlier that he has to subtitute his colleague for this talk but this is the first public talk and it was pretty good!!!
