[EBRC Annual Meeting 2022](https://ebrc.org/ebrc-2022-annual-meeting-in-berkeley-california/) was held at UC Berkeley, California, for this year after coming back from COVID.
Ice was supported by EBRC as a board member of Student and Postdoc Association (SPA) and presented a poster at this conference.
It was such a great opportunity to attend an in-person conference with scientists in the field.
Apart from my research poster, I am also in charge of our DEI initiatives poster!
